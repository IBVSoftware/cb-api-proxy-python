## Quick Start: Using OpenAPI to Generate a Client for CB API

The CB API provides an OpenAPI JSON definition that can be used to automatically generate client proxies in various programming languages. This guide will help you get started quickly by showing you how to download the OpenAPI JSON and generate a client using the OpenAPI Generator tool.

### Step 1: Download the OpenAPI JSON
The OpenAPI definition for the CB API is available at the following URL:

```
<Insert OpenAPI JSON URL here>
```

Download this file and save it locally as `cb_openapi.json`.

### Step 2: Install OpenAPI Generator
The OpenAPI Generator tool allows you to create client libraries for different programming languages from the OpenAPI definition.

#### Installation Instructions:

1. **macOS/Linux (via Homebrew):**
   ```bash
   brew install openapi-generator
   ```

2. **Node.js (via npm):**
   ```bash
   npm install @openapitools/openapi-generator-cli -g
   ```

3. **Other Platforms:**
   You can download the OpenAPI Generator from the official [OpenAPI Generator Releases page](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/releases).

### Step 3: Generate Client Code
Once the OpenAPI Generator is installed, you can generate the client code for your preferred programming language.

For example, to generate a Python client:

```bash
openapi-generator generate -i cb_openapi.json -g python -o ./cb_client
```

Replace `python` with the language you want to use (e.g., `java`, `typescript`, `csharp`, etc.).

### Step 4: Integrate the Generated Client
After the client is generated, you can integrate it into your project and start making API calls to CB using the generated proxy classes.

### Supported Languages
The OpenAPI Generator supports a wide range of programming languages, including but not limited to:

- Python
- Java
- JavaScript/TypeScript
- C#
- Ruby
- Go
- PHP
